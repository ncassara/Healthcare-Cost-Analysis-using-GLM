Health Insurance Cost Prediction

This project analyzes health insurance data to predict individual medical charges using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM). It showcases skills in data analysis, statistical modeling, and communicating key findings for an aspiring actuary.

Project Files:
-insurance.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook with all the code, analysis, and visualizations.
-insurance.csv: The raw dataset used for the project.

Key Findings:
-Smoking is the main driver--smokers' charges are predicted to be 4.5 times higher than non-smokers'.
-Age and BMI also have a significant, positive impact on costs.
-The GLM is a strong fit, explaining 68% of the variance in charges.

How to Run:
Clone the repository and run the insurance.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment. The code is well-commented and easy to follow.
